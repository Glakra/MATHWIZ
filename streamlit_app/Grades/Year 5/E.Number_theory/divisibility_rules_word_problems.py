        ### How to Solve Divisibility Word Problems:
        
        #### **Step 1: Identify the Key Information**
        - **What number** needs to be divided?
        - **What are we dividing by** (groups, people, items)?
        - **What condition** must be met (equal groups, no remainder)?
        
        #### **Step 2: Apply Divisibility Rules**
        - **Divisibility by 2:** Even numbers (ends in 0,2,4,6,8)
        - **Divisibility by 3:** Sum of digits divisible by 3
        - **Divisibility by 4:** Last two digits divisible by 4
        - **Divisibility by 5:** Ends in 0 or 5
        - **Divisibility by 6:** Divisible by both 2 AND 3
        - **Divisibility by 8:** Last three digits divisible by 8
        - **Divisibility by 9:** Sum of digits divisible by 9
        - **Divisibility by 10:** Ends in 0
        
        #### **Step 3: Check Each Option**
        - Test each answer choice using the appropriate rule
        - Look for patterns and shortcuts
        - Eliminate impossible answers first
        
        ### **Example Problem:**
        **"240 students need to be divided into equal groups. Which group sizes are possible?"**
        
        **Analysis:**
        - Number to divide: 240
        - Need: Equal groups (no remainder)
        - Check: Which numbers divide 240 evenly?
        
        **Testing:**
        - **240 √∑ 5:** 240 ends in 0 ‚Üí ‚úÖ Divisible by 5
        - **240 √∑ 8:** Last three digits 240 ‚Üí 240√∑8=30 ‚Üí ‚úÖ Divisible by 8
        - **240 √∑ 12:** 240 is even ‚úÖ and 2+4+0=6 (√∑3) ‚úÖ ‚Üí ‚úÖ Divisible by 12
        
        ### **Common Scenarios:**
        - **Elections/Voting:** Equal distribution of votes
        - **Classroom Organization:** Students in equal groups
        - **Sports Teams:** Players divided equally
        - **Packaging:** Items in equal containers
        - **Money Distribution:** Equal shares
        - **Event Planning:** Equal table arrangements
        - **Transportation:** Equal passengers per vehicle
        
        ### **Quick Elimination Tips:**
        - **Odd numbers** can't be divided by any even number
        - **Numbers not ending in 0 or 5** can't be divided by 5
        - **If sum of digits isn't divisible by 3**, not divisible by 3,6,9,12
        - **Large numbers** often have more factors than small ones
