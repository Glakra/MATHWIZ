        ### What is a Remainder?
        A **remainder** is what's **left over** after division when the numbers don't divide evenly.
        
        **Example:** 17 √∑ 5 = 3 R 2
        - **3** is how many complete groups of 5 we can make
        - **2** is the remainder (what's left over)
        
        ### How to Find Remainders:
        1. **Divide** to find how many complete groups
        2. **Multiply** the quotient by the divisor  
        3. **Subtract** from the original number
        4. **The difference is the remainder**
        
        **Example:** 23 √∑ 4 = ?
        - 23 √∑ 4 = 5 R 3
        - Check: 5 √ó 4 = 20, and 23 - 20 = 3 ‚úì
        
        ### Real-World Remainder Meanings:
        
        **üé¢ Tickets & Rides:**
        - "How many tickets left?" ‚Üí The remainder
        - "287 tickets, 2 per ride" ‚Üí 287 √∑ 2 = 143 R **1 ticket left**
        
        **üçï Food & Sharing:**
        - "How many pieces left over?" ‚Üí The remainder  
        - "23 pieces, 4 per person" ‚Üí 23 √∑ 4 = 5 R **3 pieces left**
        
        **üì¶ Packing & Items:**
        - "How many items don't fit?" ‚Üí The remainder
        - "47 toys, 6 per box" ‚Üí 47 √∑ 6 = 7 R **5 toys don't fit**
        
        **üéà Party Planning:**
        - "How many balloons left?" ‚Üí The remainder
        - "85 balloons, 8 per table" ‚Üí 85 √∑ 8 = 10 R **5 balloons left**
        
        **‚è∞ Time & Scheduling:**
        - "How many minutes extra?" ‚Üí The remainder
        - "67 minutes, 15 per session" ‚Üí 67 √∑ 15 = 4 R **7 minutes extra**
        
        ### Key Question Types:
        - **"How many ... left?"** ‚Üí Find the remainder
        - **"How many ... left over?"** ‚Üí Find the remainder  
        - **"How many extra ...?"** ‚Üí Find the remainder
        - **"How many ... remaining?"** ‚Üí Find the remainder
        - **"How many ... will not fit?"** ‚Üí Find the remainder
        
        ### Remember:
        - The remainder is **always smaller** than the divisor
        - If remainder = 0, then it divides evenly (no leftovers)
        - Focus on **what the remainder represents** in the story
        
        ### Example Walkthrough:
        **"Sarah has 58 stickers. She puts 7 stickers on each page. How many stickers will be left over?"**
        
        **Step 1:** 58 √∑ 7 = ?
        **Step 2:** 58 √∑ 7 = 8 R 2
        **Step 3:** The remainder is 2
        **Answer:** 2 stickers will be left over

        ### Problem Breakdown:
        **What we know:**
        - Total {unit}: {total:,}
        - Group size: {divisor}
        - Question: "How many {unit} will be left over?"
        
        ### Step 1: Set up the division
        {total:,} √∑ {divisor} = ?
        
        ### Step 2: Calculate the division
        {total:,} √∑ {divisor} = {quotient} R {remainder}
        
        ### Step 3: Interpret the remainder
        - **Quotient ({quotient}):** Number of complete groups
        - **Remainder ({remainder}):** Number of {unit} left over
        - **The question asks for the remainder**
        
        ### Step 4: Answer the question
        **{remainder} {unit} will be left over**

            **Think of it this way:**
            - If you have {total} {unit}
            - And you make groups of {divisor}
            - You can make {quotient} complete groups ({quotient} √ó {divisor} = {quotient * divisor})
            - That uses {quotient * divisor} {unit}
            - So {total} - {quotient * divisor} = **{remainder} {unit} left over**

        ### Remember:
        - The **remainder** is always what's "left over"
        - It's always **smaller than the divisor** ({remainder} < {divisor})
        - It answers questions like "How many will be left?" or "How many extra?"
