        ### How to Solve Division Word Problems:
        
        #### **Step 1: Read Carefully**
        - **Read the problem twice** to understand what's happening
        - **Identify the key information** (numbers and what they represent)
        - **Find the question** being asked
        
        #### **Step 2: Identify the Operation**
        - Look for **division keywords**: "packages of", "groups of", "per", "each", "split equally"
        - Ask: **"Am I sharing or grouping?"**
        
        #### **Step 3: Set Up the Division**
        - **Total amount √∑ Size of each group = Number of groups**
        - **Total amount √∑ Number of groups = Size of each group**
        
        #### **Step 4: Handle Remainders**
        - **Round UP** when you need whole packages/trips/groups
        - **Round DOWN** when the remainder can't be used
        - **Use the exact remainder** when it represents leftover items
        
        ### Common Scenarios:
        
        **üõí Shopping Problems:**
        - "Items come in packages of X" ‚Üí Usually round UP
        - "How many complete packages?" ‚Üí Use quotient only
        
        **üöå Transportation Problems:**
        - "How many buses needed?" ‚Üí Usually round UP
        - "How many people per bus?" ‚Üí Use quotient, remainder = extra people
        
        **üéØ Equal Groups:**
        - "Split equally among X people" ‚Üí Quotient = amount per person
        - "How many complete teams?" ‚Üí Use quotient only
        
        **üì¶ Packaging Problems:**
        - "How many boxes needed?" ‚Üí Round UP
        - "How many items left over?" ‚Üí Use remainder
        
        ### Example Walkthrough:
        **"72 students, 8 students per bus. How many buses needed?"**
        - 72 √∑ 8 = 9 R 0
        - Answer: 9 buses (no remainder, so exactly 9 buses)
        
        **"73 students, 8 students per bus. How many buses needed?"**  
        - 73 √∑ 8 = 9 R 1
        - Answer: 10 buses (need to round UP for the 1 extra student)
        
        ### Key Words to Look For:
        - **"packages of"** ‚Üí Division needed, often round UP
        - **"groups of"** ‚Üí Division needed
        - **"equally"** ‚Üí Division for fair sharing
        - **"per"** ‚Üí Division (rate problems)
        - **"how many complete"** ‚Üí Use quotient only
        - **"how many more needed"** ‚Üí Look at remainder
