        ### How to Solve Mixed Number Word Problems:
        
        **Step 1: Identify the numbers**
        - Find the mixed numbers in the problem
        - Note what operation to use (add or subtract)
        
        **Step 2: Set up the problem**
        - Write the equation with the mixed numbers
        - Make sure denominators are the same
        
        **Step 3: Solve**
        - Add/subtract whole numbers
        - Add/subtract fractions
        - Simplify if needed
        
        ### Example:
        "A baker used 2 3/4 cups of flour for bread and 1 1/4 cups for cookies. How much flour in total?"
        - 2 3/4 + 1 1/4
        - = (2 + 1) + (3/4 + 1/4)
        - = 3 + 4/4
        - = 3 + 1 = 4 cups
        
        ### How to Enter Your Answer:
        - **Whole number:** Just type the number (e.g., 5)
        - **Fraction:** Type as numerator/denominator (e.g., 3/4)
        - **Mixed number:** Type as whole fraction (e.g., 2 3/4)
        
        ### Tips:
        - Read carefully to identify if you add or subtract
        - Check your answer makes sense in context
        - Remember to include the unit in your thinking
