        ### Steps to Solve:
        1. **Read carefully** - Identify what fractions to add
        2. **Write the equation** - List all fractions with + signs
        3. **Find the LCD** - Find common denominator
        4. **Convert fractions** - Make all denominators the same
        5. **Add numerators** - Keep the denominator
        6. **Simplify** - Reduce to lowest terms
        7. **Check** - Does your answer make sense?
        
        ### Example:
        "Tom ate 1/2 of a pizza, 1/4 of another, and 1/8 of a third."
        - Equation: 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8
        - LCD = 8
        - 4/8 + 2/8 + 1/8 = 7/8
        - Tom ate 7/8 of a pizza in total
