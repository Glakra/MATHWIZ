        ### How to Solve:
        - **Read the problem carefully** and identify what you need to find
        - **Look for the two numbers** you need to multiply
        - **Set up the multiplication** (larger number √ó smaller number)
        - **Show your work** step by step
        - **Check your answer** makes sense in context
        
        ### Multiplication Strategies:
        - **Standard Algorithm:** Stack the numbers and multiply
        - **Area Model:** Break numbers into parts
        - **Distributive Property:** (20 + 3) √ó 45 = (20 √ó 45) + (3 √ó 45)
        
        ### Example Problem:
        *"A school has 24 classrooms. Each classroom has 35 desks. How many desks are there in total?"*
        
        **Step 1:** Identify the numbers: 24 classrooms, 35 desks each
        **Step 2:** Set up: 24 √ó 35
        **Step 3:** Calculate: 24 √ó 35 = 840
        **Step 4:** Answer: 840 desks
        
        ### Difficulty Levels:
        - **üü° Level 1-2:** Smaller two-digit numbers (11-25)
        - **üü† Level 3:** Medium numbers (26-50) 
        - **üî¥ Level 4-5:** Larger numbers (51-99)
        
        ### Scoring:
        - ‚úÖ **Correct answer:** Move to next level
        - ‚ùå **Wrong answer:** Stay at current level and try again
        - üéØ **Goal:** Master Level 5 problems!
