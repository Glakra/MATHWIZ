        ### How to Play:
        - **Read the word problem carefully**
        - **Identify what operation to use** (addition or subtraction)
        - **Type your answer** in the input box
        - **Check your work** before submitting
        
        ### Problem-Solving Strategy:
        1. **Understand:** What is the problem asking?
        2. **Plan:** What operation do I need?
        3. **Solve:** Do the math carefully
        4. **Check:** Does my answer make sense?
        
        ### Key Words to Look For:
        - **Addition:** total, altogether, combined, sum, plus, more, gained, won
        - **Subtraction:** difference, less, fewer, minus, lost, gave away, left, remained
        
        ### Tips for Success:
        - **Read twice:** Make sure you understand what's happening
        - **Visualize:** Picture the problem in your head
        - **Estimate:** Does your answer seem reasonable?
        - **Units matter:** Include $ for money problems when appropriate
        
        ### Difficulty Progression:
        - ‚úÖ **Correct answers:** Numbers get bigger (more challenging)
        - ‚ùå **Wrong answers:** Numbers get smaller (easier practice)
        - üéØ **Goal:** Master problems with numbers up to 1,000!
