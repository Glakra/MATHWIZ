        ### How to Solve Word Problems with Estimation:
        
        #### üîπ **Step 1: Read Carefully**
        - Find the two numbers you need to multiply
        - Understand what the problem is asking for
        - Look for keywords like "each," "per," "total," "altogether"
        
        #### üîπ **Step 2: Round Smart**
        - Round to numbers that are easy to multiply mentally
        - Usually round to nearest 10, 100, or 1000
        - Choose rounding that makes sense for the context
        
        #### üîπ **Step 3: Estimate**
        - Multiply the rounded numbers
        - Use mental math with the easier numbers
        - Get a reasonable ballpark answer
        
        #### üîπ **Step 4: Choose Wisely**
        - Compare your estimate to the answer choices
        - Pick the answer closest to your estimate
        - Think about whether your answer makes sense
        
        ### üí∞ **Example from Art Gallery:**
        - **Problem:** 71 vases √ó $936 each
        - **Round:** 70 √ó $900 = $63,000
        - **Or:** 70 √ó $1000 = $70,000 (too high)
        - **Best estimate:** $63,000
        
        ### üéØ **Estimation Tips:**
        - **Round both numbers** if they're both complex
        - **Keep one exact** if it's simple (like 5, 10, 25)
        - **Think reasonably** - does your answer make sense?
        - **Check magnitude** - thousands? tens of thousands?
        
        ### üìö **Scenario Types:**
        - üõí Shopping & retail
        - üèóÔ∏è Construction & building  
        - üçï Food & cooking
        - üöó Transportation
        - üè´ School situations
        - ‚öΩ Sports & entertainment
        - üå± Nature & science
