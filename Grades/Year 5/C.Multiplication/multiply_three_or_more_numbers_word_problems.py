        ### How to Solve Multi-Step Multiplication:
        - **Read carefully** and identify all the numbers you need to multiply
        - **Find the pattern** - look for groups, layers, or repeated structures
        - **Set up the multiplication** with 3 or more factors
        - **Calculate step by step** - multiply from left to right or group smart pairs
        - **Check your answer** makes sense in the real-world context
        
        ### Common Problem Types:
        1. **Arrays/Grids:** rows √ó columns √ó items per space
        2. **Time Patterns:** rate √ó time periods √ó number of cycles
        3. **Packaging:** items per package √ó packages per box √ó number of boxes
        4. **Money Problems:** price √ó quantity √ó number of groups
        5. **Building/Construction:** length √ó width √ó height or layers
        
        ### Solution Strategies:
        - **Left to Right:** 4 √ó 3 √ó 5 = (4 √ó 3) √ó 5 = 12 √ó 5 = 60
        - **Smart Grouping:** 8 √ó 5 √ó 2 √ó 3 = (8 √ó 2) √ó (5 √ó 3) = 16 √ó 15 = 240
        - **Look for 10s:** 2 √ó 7 √ó 5 = (2 √ó 5) √ó 7 = 10 √ó 7 = 70
        
        ### Example Problem:
        *"A bakery makes 4 trays of muffins. Each tray has 6 rows with 3 muffins per row. How many muffins in total?"*
        
        **Solution:** 4 trays √ó 6 rows √ó 3 muffins = 72 muffins
        
        ### Difficulty Levels:
        - **üü° Level 1-2:** 3 factors, smaller numbers
        - **üü† Level 3:** 3-4 factors, medium numbers
        - **üî¥ Level 4-5:** 4-5 factors, larger numbers
        
        ### Key Skills:
        - ‚úÖ **Identify** all factors in the problem
        - ‚úÖ **Organize** the multiplication setup
        - ‚úÖ **Calculate** accurately step by step
        - ‚úÖ **Verify** the answer makes sense
