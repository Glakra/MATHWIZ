        ### How to Solve Division Word Problems:
        - **Read carefully** to understand what's being shared or grouped
        - **Identify the total amount** (dividend)
        - **Identify how many groups** or people (divisor)
        - **Calculate how much each gets** (quotient)
        
        ### Types of Division Problems:
        1. **Equal Sharing:** "24 cookies shared equally among 6 children"
        2. **Equal Grouping:** "18 pencils put into groups of 3"
        3. **Rate Problems:** "40 miles in 5 hours"
        
        ### Problem-Solving Steps:
        1. **Find the total** (what's being divided)
        2. **Find the groups** (how many parts)
        3. **Set up division:** total √∑ groups = amount per group
        4. **Check your answer** - multiply back to verify
        
        ### Key Words to Look For:
        - **"each"** - usually indicates division
        - **"equally"** - sharing evenly
        - **"groups of"** - making equal groups
        - **"per"** - rate problems (each, every)
        - **"shared among"** - dividing between people
        
        ### Example Problem:
        *"A group of 9 students collected 72 cans. If they each collected the same amount, how many cans did each student collect?"*
        
        **Solution:** 72 √∑ 9 = 8 cans per student
        
        ### Check Your Work:
        **Multiplication Check:** 8 √ó 9 = 72 ‚úì
        
        ### Difficulty Levels:
        - **üü° Level 1-2:** Division by 1, 2, 5, 10 (easier divisors)
        - **üü† Level 3:** Division by 3, 4, 6 (medium divisors)
        - **üî¥ Level 4-5:** All division facts 1-10 (all divisors)
        
        ### Key Skills:
        - ‚úÖ **Read and comprehend** word problems
        - ‚úÖ **Identify division situations** in real contexts
        - ‚úÖ **Set up division equations** from word problems
        - ‚úÖ **Apply division facts** to solve problems

        - Total amount: **{data['dividend']} {data['unit']}**
        - Number of groups/people: **{data['divisor']}**
        - We need to find: Amount per group/person

        {data['dividend']} √∑ {data['divisor']} = ?
        
        **Step 3: Calculate**
        {data['dividend']} √∑ {data['divisor']} = **{correct_answer}**
        
        **Final Answer:** {correct_answer} {data['unit']}

        This means {data['divisor']} groups of {correct_answer} {data['unit']} each gives us {data['dividend']} {data['unit']} total.
